# AttributerLibrary
AttributerLibrary is an Attribute library that created by using Interceptor. This library allows any of your methods to be executed before or after they run. 
# Installation
You can start with creating a Attributer object.
```csharp
IExample productBusiness = AttributerPatcher<IExample, Example>.Create();
```

Or you can Dependency Injection if you are going to use it in ASP.Net Core projects. 
```csharp
builder.Services.AddScopedWithAttributer<IExampleBusiness, ExampleBusiness>();
//or
builder.Services.AddTransientWithAttributer<IExampleBusiness, ExampleBusiness>();
//or
builder.Services.AddSingletonWithAttributer<IExampleBusiness, ExampleBusiness>();
```

# Usage

First, create a Special Attribute Class which is a Base Model **Attributer**. There are 2 methods that can be overridden from **Attributer** Base Model. These 2 methods allow you to add the Attribute that created to Method or Class which will be used and with this you can configure the actions you take before or after the method is called.
```csharp
internal class LogAttribute : Attributer
    {
        public override void OnAfterExecuted(AttributerContext context)
        {
            ...
            base.OnAfterExecuted(context);
        }
        
        public override void OnBeforeExecute(AttributerContext context)
        {
            ...
            base.OnBeforeExecute(context);
        }
    }
```

For example, using a Method or a Class
```csharp
using ...

namespace BusinessLibrary.Business
{
    [Log]
    public class ExampleBusiness : IExampleBusiness
    {
        ...
        ...
    }
}
```

```csharp
using ...

namespace BusinessLibrary.Business
{
    public class ExampleBusiness : IExampleBusiness
    {
        [Log]
        public Example GetExample(int id)
        {
            ...
        }
    }
}
```
